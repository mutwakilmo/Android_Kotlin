**Kotlin**  is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose programming language with type inference. Kotlin is designed to interoperate fully with Java, and the JVM version of its standard library depends on the Java Class Library, but type inference allows its syntax to be more concise.

Kotlin was introduced in Google I/O 2017 and it was officially announced as the preferred language for Android app developers on 7th May, Google I/O 2019.

This short presentation at Google I/0 2017 on  [Introduction to Kotlin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1RVYt2QKQE)  gives us a good glimpse and overview of the language and its capabilities.
